Step8 servo angle initialization
--------------------------------      
Before installing the servo shaft, the power switch must be turned on to run the factory program and initialize the servo to 90 degrees. If the servo is at 90 degrees, it will not rotate and will not produce any sound when turned on; If the servo is not at 90 degrees, the servo will rotate and produce sound when turned on (this is a probability event).
